# Virtualized Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board

A lightweight, high-performance drag-and-drop implementation with virtualized scrolling for handling large datasets efficiently.

## Features

- **Virtualized Scrolling**: Only renders visible items plus a small buffer, significantly reducing DOM elements and improving performance
- **Smooth Drag-and-Drop**: Optimized drag-and-drop with animations and visual feedback
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable components
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
  - Batches DOM operations with document fragments
  - Uses CSS transforms instead of left/top for better performance
  - Implements debouncing and throttling for event handlers
  - Minimizes reflows and repaints
- **Memory Efficient**: Properly cleans up event listeners and DOM elements
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks

## How It Works

### Virtualized Scrolling

The `VirtualScroller` class implements an efficient virtualization technique that only renders items currently visible in the viewport, plus a small buffer. As the user scrolls, items that move out of view are removed from the DOM, and new items coming into view are added. This significantly reduces the number of DOM elements and improves performance, especially for large lists.

### Drag-and-Drop

The `DragManager` class provides a lightweight drag-and-drop implementation that uses the Pointer Events API for cross-device compatibility. It creates a visual clone that follows the cursor during dragging and provides visual feedback with highlighting of source and target areas. The implementation uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations and minimizes DOM operations.

### Component Architecture

The `KanbanBoard` class integrates the `VirtualScroller` and `DragManager` to create a complete kanban board. It manages the board state, handles item movement between columns, and provides a clean API for adding and removing tasks.

## Performance Considerations

- **DOM Operations**: Minimizes DOM operations by using document fragments and recycling elements
- **Animation Performance**: Uses CSS transforms and `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- **Event Handling**: Uses debouncing and throttling to limit the frequency of expensive operations
- **Memory Management**: Properly cleans up event listeners and DOM elements to prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks

## Browser Support

This implementation uses modern JavaScript features (ES modules, arrow functions, etc.) and is designed for modern browsers. It should work in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) released in the last few years.

## Running the Project

Simply serve the files using any HTTP server. For example:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server

# Using Node.js with http-server
npx http-server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
